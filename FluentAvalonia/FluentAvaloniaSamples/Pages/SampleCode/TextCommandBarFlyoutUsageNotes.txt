You don't specify commands for a TextCommandBarFlyout, they're automatically preset based on the controls they're attached to. It's a bit limited because we don't have rich text support yet.
TextCommandBarFlyout is the default ContextFlyout for TextBox in FluentAvalonia. It will adapt based on clipboard state, text selection, password box, etc. No Bold/Italic/Underline options are available yet, however.

TextBlocks also can be provided one to offer a 'Copy' command to copy the TextBlock's text to the clipboard. Just declare a TextCommandBarFlyout as a resource, and reference it as the TextBlock's ContextFlyout.
